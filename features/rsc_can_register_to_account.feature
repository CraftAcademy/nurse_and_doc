    As an RSC,

    I would like to add more RSCs to manage assignments by using their email address

    Background:

            | email           | password   |
            | email@email.com | mypassword |

        And the RSC user is logged in as "email@email.com"
        And I am on the landing page
        And I click on "Create RSC account"

    Scenario: RSC can sucessfully add another RSC user to access the platform
        Given I fill in "Email" with "newrsc@email.com"
        And I click on "Create account"
        Then I should see the message "RSC user newrsc@email.com created, currently logged in as email@email.com."

        And I fill in "Password" with "password"
        And I click on "Log in"
