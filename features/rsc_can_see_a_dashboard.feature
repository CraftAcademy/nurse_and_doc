Feature: RSC Dashboard
    As a RSC,
    In order to create and modify relevant informations to be sent out to RSC,
    I would like to have a simple and user friendly dashboard.

    Scenario: RSC can see the dashboard
        Given I am on the dashboard page
        Then I should see "RSC Dashboard"
        And I should see "Jobs" within the "sidebar" section
        And I should see "Hospitals" within the "sidebar" section
        And I should see "Staffing Companies" within the "sidebar" section
        And I should see "Job 1"

    Scenario: RSC can see the dashboard in swedish
        Given I am on the dashboard page
        Then I should see "RSC Dashboard"
        And I click the "Language" button
        Then I should see "Jobb" within the "sidebar" section
        And I should see "Sjukhus" within the "sidebar" section
        And I should see "Bemanningsf√∂retag" within the "sidebar" section
